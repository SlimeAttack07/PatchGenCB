# PatchGenCB
PatchGenCB is a prototype patch note generator I made for my Master Thesis 
"What did they do this time? How auto-mated patch notes can help make clearpatch notes for video games."

This generator uses comment based annotations and allows users to automate parts of the patch note generation process.
This generator should work for any programming language that supports comments.

Instructions will be provided once the prototype reaches a release state.


Note that this prototype may not be maintained after initial release.
